### Hi there 👋

Here are some things you need to know about me:

I specialize in building and driving mission-critical systems across fintech, payments, and data infrastructure. From architecting modular financial platforms to solving complex data orchestration challenges, I’ve led the development of scalable solutions that power digital finance at scale. 

My work is driven by a deep focus on reliability, security, and innovation—turning technical complexity into real-world financial impact.

I led Bitpowr from inception to processing over $1 billion in transaction volume, powering financial operations for businesses across the digital asset ecosystem.

Now I am working on Knowledge Layer for AI Agents
